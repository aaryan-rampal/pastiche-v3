# Pastiche: Sketch-to-Artwork Matching System

_Transform your hand-drawn sketches into connections with masterpiece artworks through advanced computer vision and shape analysis._

## 🎨 Project Overview

Pastiche is an intelligent web application that matches hand-drawn sketches to artwork from a curated collection using sophisticated contour analysis. Inspired by the concept of "land lines" connecting disparate locations through similar geographical features, Pastiche creates artistic connections by finding visual similarities between user sketches and historical artworks.

The system employs a two-stage matching pipeline combining FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for rapid initial filtering with Procrustes analysis for precise shape matching, enabling users to discover artworks that share visual DNA with their creative expressions.

## Why?

I have had this idea for a while, and have executed on two different occasions. Once at Hack the North 2023, another one after the hackathon since I didn't feel like I did a good enough job. Hence why this is Pastiche v3. So why again?

Because I can do better. I am better at ML, backend, frontend, and so is the technology. So why not give it one last shot?

## 🔗 Inspiration: Land Lines

This project draws inspiration from "[Land Lines](https://lines.chromeexperiments.com/)" by Zach Lieberman, an interactive experiment that finds satellite imagery matching drawn lines. Pastiche extends this concept to the art world, creating connections between personal creativity and historical masterpieces through the universal language of shape and form.

Just as Land Lines reveals the hidden patterns in our planet's geography, Pastiche uncovers the visual relationships that connect human artistic expression across centuries and cultures.

## 🛠 Technical Implementation

### FAISS Index Configuration

```python
# Enhanced feature vector (9 dimensions)
features = np.array([
    hu_moments[0:7],           # 7 Hu moments
])

# L2 distance with 100 nearest neighbors
index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(7)
index.add(features.astype('float32'))
```

### Procrustes Shape Analysis

```python
def procrustes_distance(shape1, shape2):
    # Align centroids
    shape1_centered = shape1 - shape1.mean(axis=0)
    shape2_centered = shape2 - shape2.mean(axis=0)

    # Scale normalization
    shape1_scaled = shape1_centered / np.sqrt((shape1_centered**2).sum())
    shape2_scaled = shape2_centered / np.sqrt((shape2_centered**2).sum())

    # Optimal rotation via SVD
    M = shape1_scaled.T @ shape2_scaled
    U, _, Vt = np.linalg.svd(M)
    R = U @ Vt

    # Compute alignment error
    aligned = shape2_scaled @ R.T
    return np.sqrt(((shape1_scaled - aligned)**2).sum())
```
